# BayesianOptimization_Photovoltaics
This repository contains my code that I wrote during my Master's Thesis at EPFL and CSEM. It uses Bayesian Optimization to find the optimum optical performance of tandems and other photovoltaics.

The two files data_frame_tandem.csv and PK_Si_tandem_DST_reference.txt are to opened inside the code.

This code requires CROWM and a MATLAB script connecting the code to CROWM.
